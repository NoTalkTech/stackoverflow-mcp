# PRD: StackOverflow MCP Server

## 1. Product overview

### 1.1 Document title and version

- PRD: StackOverflow MCP Server
- Version: 1.1

### 1.2 Product summary

This project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI agents and clients to query StackOverflow for programming-related questions and answers. The server provides a bridge between AI systems and StackOverflow's vast knowledge base, allowing for intelligent retrieval of relevant programming solutions.

The MCP server is designed to be lightweight, efficient, and easily deployable via npx, making it accessible for various development workflows and AI agent integrations. The project will be published as an npm package for seamless distribution and installation.

## 2. Goals

### 2.1 Business goals

- Support scalable deployment options

### 2.2 User goals

- Query StackOverflow content programmatically through AI agents
- Access relevant programming solutions quickly
- Avoid manual StackOverflow browsing during development
- Integrate StackOverflow knowledge into development workflows
- Install and run the server easily via npm/npx without manual setup

### 2.3 Non-goals

- Full StackOverflow data scraping or mirroring
- User authentication or account management
- Content creation or posting to StackOverflow
- Advanced analytics or reporting features
