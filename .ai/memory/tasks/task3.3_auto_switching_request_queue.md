## Description

实现免费和API访问的自动切换及请求队列管理

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive request queue system with auto-switching capabilities:

### Core Components Implemented:

1. **RequestPriority Enum**: LOW, NORMAL, HIGH, URGENT priority levels for request management
2. **AccessMode Enum**: AUTO, AUTHENTICATED, UNAUTHENTICATED access modes  
3. **QueuedRequest Class**: Dataclass with cache key generation, retry logic, and future-based async handling
4. **RequestCache Class**: LRU cache with TTL expiration (5-minute default, 500 entries max)
5. **RequestQueue Class**: Priority-based queue with concurrent processing, duplicate detection, and worker management

### Auto-Switching Logic Implemented:

- Intelligent access mode selection based on API key availability
- Automatic switch to unauthenticated when quota < 50 remaining
- Fallback from authenticated to unauthenticated on rate limit errors
- Integration with existing rate limiting and authentication systems

### Enhanced StackOverflowClient Features:

- Request queueing with priority support for all client methods
- Cache integration with 5-minute TTL and LRU eviction
- Auto-switching between authenticated/unauthenticated access
- Method rename: `_make_request` → `_make_raw_request` with `use_auth` parameter
- Queue-based request processing with retry mechanisms

### MCP Tools Added:

- `get_queue_status`: Monitor queue statistics, cache performance, and auto-switching configuration

### Testing Coverage:

- 17 comprehensive tests covering cache operations, request queueing, access mode decisions
- Integration tests for queue system and MCP tool functionality
- Fixed authentication tracking and method signature tests
- All 82 tests passing

## Key Features Delivered:

✅ **智能切换**: Automated switching between authenticated/unauthenticated access based on quotas and rate limits
✅ **请求队列**: Priority-based request queue with concurrent processing
✅ **优先级管理**: Four-level priority system (LOW/NORMAL/HIGH/URGENT)
✅ **自动重试**: Built-in retry mechanism with exponential backoff
✅ **请求去重**: Duplicate request detection using cache keys
✅ **缓存策略**: LRU cache with TTL expiration for request responses
✅ **队列监控**: Real-time queue status monitoring through MCP tools
✅ **超时处理**: Request timeout and error handling
✅ **负载均衡**: Concurrent request processing with semaphore control

## Architecture Integration:

- Seamlessly integrated with existing rate limiting (Task 3.1) and authentication (Task 3.2) systems
- Enhanced all search methods (`search_questions`, `search_by_tags`, `get_question_details`) with queue support
- Maintained backward compatibility while adding advanced queue management
- Added comprehensive monitoring and status reporting capabilities

## Impact:

- Improved API efficiency through intelligent access mode switching
- Enhanced user experience with request caching and automatic retries  
- Better resource utilization through request deduplication
- Comprehensive monitoring for operational visibility
- Foundation for advanced features like load balancing and failover

Task completed successfully with full test coverage and integration.
